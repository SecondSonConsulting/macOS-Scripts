#
#Usage:
# Can be run as a Mosyle Custom Command or locally.
# Any other step in the script that fails will produce an easily read error report to standard output.
# Uncomment set -x above for advanced debugging

# Arguments can be defined here in the script, or passed at the command line. 
# If passed at the command line, arguments MUST BE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
# ./installGenericPKG.sh /path/to/pkg.pkgORurl md5ORteamID

# TeamID and MD5 are not required fields, but are strongly recommended to ensure you install what you think you are installing.

# PKGs can be validated prior to install by either the TeamID or an MD5 hash.
# If both TeamID and MD5 are defined in the script, both will be checked.
# When running from the command line, md5 and TeamID can be passed as either argument 2 or 3 or both
# 
# Example: Download a PKG at https://test.example.host.tld/Remote.pkg and verify by TeamID
# ./installGenericPKG.sh https://test.example.host.tld/Remote.pkg 7Q6XP5698G
#
# Example: Run a PKG from the local disk and verify by TeamID and MD5
# ./installGenericPKG.sh /path/to/installer.pkg 7Q6XP5698G 9741c346eeasdf31163e13b9db1241b3
